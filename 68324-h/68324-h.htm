<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> writing this brief sketch of the Brigade from its
inception to its final mustering out of the service, it
has not been my aim to account in any way for all the
days and nights which have elapsed during that period.
Memories fond or hateful to some of us would not
be very interesting to the rest. Looking backward
from the point of view of the Brigade as a unit, many
of those days were so monotonously alike that an attempt
to account for all would lead to idle repetition.
Well I realize that every one of them stands for something
important in the career of some one man; perhaps
his first tour of guard duty, or his first ride, a
close call, a bawling out, something accomplished,
something learnt. But I have not time, space nor
knowledge to write these details. If, however, by my
generalities I can so picture our life at Devens and
after that this little book will recall to its readers those
things I have omitted, it will have served its purpose.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE 151st BRIGADE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I. CAMP DEVENS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> April, 1917, the United States declared war against
Germany. It was no surprise, but what did it mean?
For it is one thing to declare war and another to wage
it. We had no army and no ships and three thousand
miles of ocean lay between the Yankee and the Hun.
We would of course lend money to our allies. Would
we give them our men? The answer, thank God, was
the draft law which put into being the greatest democratic
institution of our country,—the National Army.</p>

<p>Early in the fall of 1917, men from every walk of
life, from every corner of every state, thronged to
the huge, ugly, but business-like cantonments which
had grown up, like the mushroom over night. These
men, scientifically chosen, for their physique, mentality,
character and patriotism, were as diversified in
their civil life and occupations as men can be, but
they had one thing in common: ignorance of the military.
This and the single purpose that brought them
there, welded them together. If Germany scorned our
declaration of war, she must have sung another tune
as she watched us prepare to wage it.</p>

<p>Camp Devens, Massachusetts, was the rendez-vous
for New England’s Yankees. They were the personnel
of the first of the National Army Divisions, the
Seventy-Sixth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>The Divisional Artillery was to consist of the 301st,
the 302nd, and 303rd regiments, Colonels Brooke,
Craig and Conklin respectively commanding. Thus
it was that the 151st Field Artillery Brigade was born,
and with what promise! Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Massachusetts furnished the quota, with
many a generation of fighting ancestors behind them
and traditions of battles won, not only in war but in
every field of human endeavor.</p>

<p>Was it strange then that Major-General William S.
McNair, then Brigadier-General, shortly after he took
command in December of that year said that he felt
as proud as the young mother when she sees her first
born take its first four steps?</p>

<p>Those early months found us awkward and nearly
as helpless as the infant to which the General referred,
but men and officers alike were using this time to
advantage; both had to adapt themselves to new ways
of thinking and living, and even the language of the
army was as strange to us then as was French when
we finally got to France.</p>

<p>It was perhaps at this time more than any other,
that we had cause to be thankful to the General,
Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels for their able and
generous assistance in getting the younger officers over
those first hurdles. Let us here extend our utmost
appreciation to Lieutenant Colonels Rehkopf, Danforth
and Stopford whose loss to the Brigade we have
had many an occasion to regret. But they like many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
others of our best were called upon to take bigger jobs
where they could be of even greater value to the
country all were now serving.</p>

<p>In many respects those days were the hardest of
all; everything was strange. For a time, standing in
line hour after hour was an interesting novelty and
gave the ever-present jester an opportunity to exercise
his wit; so with the drills. But human beings, particularly
the Yankee variety, adapt themselves quickly
to their surroundings. Standing in line a couple of
hours for a pair of shoes or a cup of soup ceases
eventually to be an interesting novelty. And when the
soup so acquired is knocked from your hand by an
over zealous companion and soils the uniform you
must keep clean, you may perhaps forgive him and
laugh; but all that is funny therein is almost sure to
occur to your fertile mind and keen sense of humor
the first time it happens. Repetition is superfluous.</p>

<p>Being herded together, seeing the same man on either
side of you every day and all day, having to do what
you are told day and night, has but limited charms for
the independent citizen of America. Thoughts were
turned, first backward, to the days when we had been
individuals instead of a mite of a cog in a great machine,
and then forward, with the inevitable question:
how long was it all to last? We would have been
homesick, desperately so, but there was no time. A
bugle broke our sleep when it was still dark. Another
summoned us to a formation before it was physically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
possible to get dressed, from which we were marched
to breakfast. A whistle, followed by the First Sergeant’s
“Fall Out”, arrested the first mouthful and
told us we would not have time to wash mess kits
before policing. Policing was followed by inspection,
where the Captain would bawl us out for the condition
of those same wretched mess kits. Inspection was
followed by physical exercises; physical exercises by
foot drill, foot drill by a hike, the hike by mess. In
the afternoon we rehearsed the events of the morning.
Supper was followed by school, then taps, then bed,
then reveille. To-day is a repetition of yesterday,
to-morrow will be a repetition of to-day. But to-day
we are not going to be bawled out for dirty mess kits,
we wash them and are late for policing; the First
Sergeant puts us in the kitchen for a week and we
learn the meaning of K. P.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> We are soon repentant
and resolve to be on time to formation. This is the
school of the Rookie and this is how he learns the
impossible. “Take therefore no thought for the morrow,
for the morrow shall take thought for the things
of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”</p>

<p>The next quota of men come into camp; we have
graduated; they are the rookies; we are the soldiers;
we laugh; they look puzzled.</p>

<p>Then came the winter, and what a winter! Arthur
Mometer said it was zero hour all the time. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
he did not know. He was a Rookie, but somehow it
didn’t make it any warmer nor the snow less deep.
We shovelled snow and froze doing it, we had exercises
and we froze doing that, we drilled with the
same result. Live horses took the place of those
ever-to-be-remembered wooden monstrosities. We
groomed them and they bit us. We exercised them
and they kicked us. But we got hard and we got
health and we became soldiers. Individuality was
superseded by discipline.</p>

<p>About this time a touch of war and Hun Hellishness
was brought home to us. William S. McNair, Colonel
of the 6th Field Artillery was promoted in France
and ordered to America to command our Brigade.
Accordingly he left France on the U. S. S. “Antilles”.
At about 6.45 in the morning of October 17th a German
submarine succeeded in torpedoing his boat. She
sank immediately with the loss of about 65 lives. The
General was in the water for some three quarters of
an hour, when he was taken into a life boat. Six hours
later one of the convoy, the Morgan yacht “Corsair”
returned from trying to find the submarine and took
aboard all the survivors. They returned to France
and two weeks later the General again sailed for home
on the transport “Tenadores”. The “Tenadores” has
since been sunk by a mine, but happily for the Brigade
it was not on this voyage.</p>

<p>Christmas came and with it the joy of home for a
few, but the majority of the men must stay in camp.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
It was all part of the great task we had undertaken.
We accepted it as such. Transportation was not available
to move our now vast army to its homes. We
made merry, or rather, we did better than that; we
pretended to make merry. We sang the songs we had
rehearsed for the occasion. It was a holiday. There
were no drills. We had time to think. We can be
honest now. Our thoughts were not those of the
schoolboy on his holiday with his plans for stockings
and Christmas tree, dinner and stomach ache. They
were far-away thoughts of things, once commonplace
and taken for granted, now suddenly and forever
dearer than life itself; things which in fact made life
worth while. Home, loved, of course, but so much a
part of us that we had grown to accept it as a matter
of right. But strangely enough our thoughts carried
us farther. We found that we were longing for the
little individual problems of our daily routine in the
past,—problems that had once perplexed and annoyed
us we now craved as a hungry man craves food.</p>

<p>Months slipped by, and with them the winter.
Spring rumors of France took the place of winter
rumors, but the warm weather and a few guns found
us ready for the real work of artillerymen. Reveille
was an hour earlier and retreat an hour later. But
we were up hours before reveille with a call to stables
followed by boots and saddles. We hitched the horses
to the guns in the darkness, that we might get all the
daylight on the range. A runaway was not an unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
diversion. But as we had become fit, so did the horses.
Every day saw men and horses in better condition and
better trained. Team work and order was taking the
place of individual endeavor and chaos. A machine
with intelligence was in the making, and results were
beginning to assert themselves. Each cog was finding
its place and taking hold with a will. A sharp command
in the crisp air put the works instantly in motion,
where a month before explanations, demonstrations,
repeated attempts and failures had only succeeded in
getting parts of our engine to function. Now the gears
were adjusted, we needed but to limber them up and
oil the parts. An occasional “Well Done” would take
the place of continuous reprimand. We became proud
of ourselves and our organization. A healthy spirit
of rivalry stalked abroad. We were the <i>best</i> section
in the <i>best</i> battery, and of course our regiment was
the <i>best</i> in the Brigade, if not in the army! Officers
were proud of their men, and the men were proud of
the officers. Each began to know the other, his powers
and his limitations. Sympathy took the place of misunderstanding
and surliness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Colonel Geo. M. Brooke</span></p>

<p>So on the range, the officers acquired the theoretical
elements of artillery firing. They learnt to figure their
data with accuracy and to convey it to their batteries
in terse and comprehensive commands. The men in
their turn were seeing the purpose of the monotonous
daily drills of the six months past and the value of
team work. They acquired an intimate knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the pieces they were serving; the delicacy of the
mechanism and the consequent necessity for accurate
laying. They responded with alacrity to the orders
of their superiors, and the guns responded to the
slightest touch of the crews. All were alert, smart,
prompt,—officers and men alike, fascinated with the
possibilities of the game they were rapidly learning to
play. Even the details, after months of labor, became
proficient at the wig wag, semaphore, buzzer, map-making
and sketching; in short, all of those things
which we discovered later, played such an important
part in winning the war.</p>

<p>So when the government inspectors began to look us
over and rumors flew faster, we were not found wanting.
The wheels were oiled and the spirit was there.</p>

<p>But here I am rudely stopped by the adjutant of the
301st who says we can’t leave Devens without a Horse
Show. Of course he is right. It can’t be done, although
it does seem tough after having oiled the wheels
to such perfection. However what must be done shall
be done gracefully; so thought Captain Page at the
second hurdle where he decided to make the rest of
the trip on his ear.</p>

<p>And the horses, too, grasped the spirit. Like many
people they enjoyed the show from without the ring
better than within it. Some came on the scene with
dignity, only to bolt the next minute, not to reappear.
Some merely confounded their riders by refusing
jumps, while others were unmannered enough to refuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to show. For all that, it was a Horse Show and
one of which to be proud.</p>

<p>Since ceremonies are in order, let us not forget the
prayer which took place one memorable day on the
Parade Ground with the entire Division drawn up for
the occasion. Here a horse also figured,—the Division
Adjutant’s. As the parson began to pray, the horse
started to jump and those who were nearest insisted
that the adjutant outdid the parson. I will not say,
for I could hear the adjutant and I could not hear
the parson. This was the last time the Division was
together as a unit.</p>

<p>One day toward the end of June a long train was
spotted in the quartermaster yards. Trucks were soon
busy carrying officers, men and their baggage in that
direction. Of course, nobody knew that an advance
party of some hundred officers and three hundred men
had been secretly ordered to report to the Commanding
General, Port of Embarkation, New York, for
transportation overseas. On June 27th they sailed on
the British liner “Justicia”, which was sunk on her
return trip. But the American soldier is no fool. He
has learnt to keep his eyes open and his mouth shut,
to believe about half he sees and nothing he hears.
He was more sure now that the Division was about
to sail for France than if he had read it in every newspaper
in the United States.</p>

<p>In another two weeks rumors were forgotten. On
July 10th the Division was ordered overseas. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
was fact. The air was charged with excitement, which
however found its expression in orderly and untiring
hustle and bustle. Men, animals and transportation
were all worked overtime, but even balky army trucks
seemed to go for once with a will. The labors of the
last ten months were not to be in vain. We were to
have a chance to practise what we had learnt and perhaps
to show the Hun a few tricks of his own game.</p>

<p>The Artillery were the last to leave. It was not a
difficult task. We were to receive our materiel in
France. Individual equipment only was to accompany
the troops, for we had nothing else. The few guns
we drilled with were out of date and not used abroad.
The 302nd, and 303rd regiments were already motorized
on paper, so horses were no longer needed for
them, but the 301st must have shed bitter tears for
the beautiful animals they had spent so much time and
energy to condition and train.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight lieutenants of the 302nd left ahead of
their regiment and sailed from Boston on the
“Katoomba” which touched at Halifax on its way to
Liverpool.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">II. OVERSEAS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> that last journey from Devens to Boston on July
15th there is nothing to chronicle. We were again
for that brief period of time individuals. Thought
and not action crowded the hour. And what a curious
collection of thoughts they were. Each was absorbed
with the things nearest and dearest, soon to be far
away. But there were other, exciting thoughts. We
were on our way! What boats were to carry us? The
sea! What were we going to accomplish? And that
far-away France,—what was it like? And war, what
was it like? Would we come back?</p>

<p>The train stopped. “Fall out”. There was a
scramble for one’s possessions, followed by another
for our places on the platform. We were marched on
board and to our bunks, where we left our belongings
and hastened on deck. All was again hustle and excitement.
The gang planks were lowered, the hawsers
dropped. The whistles were blowing and we were off
for France,—off for the war, July 16th, 1918.</p>

<p>Our boat was the “Winifredian”. Soon we were
absorbed in our surroundings. There were twenty-three
ships in our convoy, curious in their camouflage,
but then all was strange to most of us, who were
not used to ocean liners. And the harbor had its
fascinations. Comparatively speaking we were men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of leisure. Jest once more asserted itself. Our
quarters while not altogether to our taste, like most
other things in the army would have to do, since there
was no alternative. We turned in and strangely
enough we slept.</p>

<p>Then sounded that good old familiar bugle with
the good old familiar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>We can’t get ’em up,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We can’t get ’em up,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We can’t get ’em up in the morning;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We can’t get ’em up,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We can’t get ’em up,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We can’t get ’em up at all.</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Where were we? Oh yes! On our way to France.
We dressed hurriedly and got up on deck. The convoy
was still there but not all of it. Four ships had
disappeared and various theories were propounded.
But just as the official dopster had got them well
sunk by a submarine and was counting the casualties,
it was announced that they had put into Halifax. Apparently
the convoy was too large and unwieldy, so
four boats had to drop out, one of which was the
“Novara” with the 301st on board. However the
other two regiments were still in the convoy and we
proceeded on our way. We had boat drill and we
wore life preservers, and we got rather bored with
both. As for guard duty and setting up exercises they
bored us eight months before. Seasickness is preferable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to either, and there were a good many of us sick.</p>

<p>While we were sailing merrily across the North
Atlantic, the 301st had disembarked at Halifax and
was playing with the Canadian troops there and thereabouts.
But it was only for a week, when they were
again on their way, this time on the “Abinsi”.</p>

<p>As the 301st left Canada, the other two regiments
landed in England, one at Liverpool, another at Bristol,
and Brigade Headquarters at Avonmouth on July 31st.</p>

<p>The next novelty was the English railway carriage
or coach, as they call it. It was the latest model limousine
with side entrances and compartments. We
tried them and landed at Camp Mornhill near Winchester,
where we found the twenty-eight officers of
the 302nd who had sailed from Boston just ahead
of us. A week later the 301st came to Winchester,
but they had become somewhat exclusive in Canada
and so on August eighth they went to Romsey instead
of our camp. Winchester apparently produces a good
deal of mud and a lot of rain. At any rate it was not
sufficiently alluring to detain us for long. We proceeded
to Southampton. “I say does it always rain
here?” But before our British friend got around to
answering us we were again on the move,—this time
to a Channel steamer, and France. So we were really
going to France and the war, and not for a tour of
the world.</p>

<p>On August 3rd the steamer that took Brigade Headquarters
and the 303rd across the English Channel, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
La Manche as the French call it, was one of our
own,—and hence, a good boat. She used to run between
Boston and New York, and her name used to
be “The Yale”. Than which there is but one better:
“The Harvard”. The 302nd crossed on her the next
day.</p>

<p>The 301st was still about a week behind the rest of
the Brigade. They sailed from Southampton on August
14th and also landed at Le Havre.</p>

<p>“So this is Frogland! Look at the frogs,—wooden
shoes and all! Even the little children speak French
here.” But they did not give us time to get acquainted.
Again we were off, this time on a French train. They
have them like the British, but this one looked like
the variety we used to play with as kids, only each
car says on the outside “40 Hommes, 8 Chevaux.” We
knew not what it meant but the stench was
indicative.</p>

<p>Two days got us to Bordeaux. We arrived on
August 6th and Brigade Headquarters was established
on August 7th at Gradignan in a very attractive villa
with beautiful grounds. The 301st also established
Headquarters at Gradignan, on August 17th, and billeted
their men in the village. You will notice that
here they were more than a week behind us. They
account for this by an aeroplane attack at Rouen. The
302nd was billeted in two little villages, Ville Nave
and Pont de la Maye, a few kilometres from Brigade
Headquarters. The 301st Ammunition Train was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Cadaujac.</p>

<p>We seemed doomed to lose a regiment. At Havre
the 303rd was ordered to Clermont Ferrand for its
training.</p>

<p>While the regiments were en route from the United
States to France, the Advance Schools Detachment of
the Brigade were wandering over Europe. From
Liverpool they went to Southampton and Le Havre,
then to Le Valdahon near the Swiss border. There
they spent a couple of weeks and saw some American
artillery training and a few Hun planes. From Le
Valdahon the contingent from the 303rd went to
Clermont and those of the other two regiments went
to Souge, near Bordeaux.</p>

<p>It was about this time that we were informed that
we were no longer a part of the 76th Division, but
were to be a Brigade of Corps Artillery. It did not
cause many tears as the 76th was already doing duty
as a replacement division with no chance of going to
the front as a unit. Our tables of organization were
changed accordingly and we were rapidly equipped for
duty in our new capacity. The 303rd regiment was
issued G. P. F.s, the famous French 155 m. m. long
rifle with a range of about 17,000 metres. The 301st
got the world renowned French 75, the best known
gun of the war, and the 302nd got American 4.7 rifles
about which nothing was known.</p>

<p>While in Gradignan and vicinity our days consisted
largely in getting acquainted with our new guns. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
also learnt French and paraded. Some of our number
were detailed to join the Advanced Schools Detachment
at Camp de Souge, August 14th.</p>

<p>On August 25th the London Evening Mail published
the news of General NcNair’s promotion. We were
of course glad of the obviously merited reward, but
selfishly would rather have had it otherwise, for of
course he would cease to be our Brigade commander.
However, at the time we consoled ourselves with the
thought that he might command the Corps artillery of
which we would be a part. That night there was a
dinner and celebration at Brigade Headquarters. The
scene was picturesque and one to be remembered. The
French Mayors of the villages where our troops were
billeted were invited and came. The meal was served
on the lawn under a huge tree in those beautiful gardens.
A hundred yards down the lawn through the
trees we could see the 301st band, conducted by Lieutenant
Keller. They played as even they had never
played before. The villagers, hearing the music,
flocked to the gates and the General sent word to the
guard that the sentries were to let them in. In they
came and went straight to the music. Sitting on the
lawn they made a huge circle around the band, and
gave our Headquarters a very festive appearance. It
was a rare occasion for them. Lovers of music that
they were, it was seldom that they had an opportunity
to hear it. Their own bands had long been busy
nearer the front.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>On September 5th and 8th the two regiments, 302nd
and 301st respectively, moved to Souge for the final
six weeks firing before going to the front. We made
the trip, some twenty miles, with our own transportation.
Brigade Headquarters was established at the
camp on September 8th and the Ammunition Train
moved in the same day.</p>

<p>Souge is located in the middle of a sand desert at
the end of the world. As far as you can see there
is not a landmark to relieve the monotony. It is as
flat as a table all the way to the sea, some twenty-five
miles distant. As Major Hadley of the 301st remarked:
“It is a nice beach but where is the water?”
Souge may best be described as follows,—a camp some
two miles long of ramshackle, broken down, foul
smelling barracks in the middle of the desert which
was to be our range. Flies, sand, dust and heat were
in abundance, as were dysentery and the “Flu” at
times. The flies were like ours except larger, more
abundant and infinitely more obnoxious. As one of
our men wrote home, he was in the hospital as a result
of having been kicked by a fly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Of all the camps in the A. E. F.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Whether S. O. S. or zone of Advance,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>You will cuss until you’re out of breath</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>This Camp de Souge in France.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>But there we were. We ate the dust, we killed flies
and we sweat in the sweltering heat, as we pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
guns, trucks and tractors through that damnable sand.</p>

<p>On September 21st the long dreaded orders for
Major-General McNair arrived and with them Secretary
of War Baker, General Tasker Bliss and a flock
of Major Generals and Brigadiers. That same day
he relinquished the command to Brigadier-General
Richmond P. Davis and left camp to take command
of the Artillery of the First Army.</p>

<p>The finishing touches were applied. We were inspected.
We passed our examinations and were ready
for the front. When would the orders come? There
were already rumors of peace,—were we to miss the
party after a year and a half of preparation? The
thought was nauseating, but we stuck to our work.
We knew our Brigade Commander was a hustler. We
could see it, and General McNair had said so. Confidence
ran high.</p>

<p>We had an abundance of ammunition and General
Davis ordered a problem to cover three days. The
guns were to go into position at night and without
lights; they did. We established communication by
telephone, radio and projector, and maintained
it. Conversation was in code and cypher. We
were to fire an offensive barrage over the infantry; it
was done. The infantry called for a defensive barrage
at 11.40 at night; it was layed before the rocket
burst.</p>

<p>Altogether in this problem of four regiments the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
75s fired about 6,000 rounds and the 4.7s about 600.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime it rained, or rather poured. The
heavens were trying to make good for the past six
months of inaction,—they did. Or perhaps it was the
302nd weeping for the now certain loss of Colonel
Craig. He had received his promotion and it was only
a question of time before his orders would arrive.
Loved and respected by all who knew him, he was to
leave a vacancy hard to fill. His officers gave him a
dinner in Bordeaux on October 7th.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III. THE FRONT</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was while our problem was in progress that General
Davis and part of his staff left for the front,
October 11th. A few days later, on October 17th, he
was followed by the rest of his staff. So the regiments
polished and oiled their materiel and entrained at the
camp for God-knows-where. One thing was certain
and that was we were going forward and not back,
for from Bordeaux it takes a boat to go in the latter
direction. It was at this time that we knew definitely
that the 301st was to leave the Brigade. It was to be
army artillery and received different orders, confirming
our fears when it was detached by telegraphic
order of October 2nd.</p>

<p>Hardly had the General with a few members of his
staff arrived at the front when a stray shell killed his
aide, Lieutenant W. B. Dixon, Jr., October 19th, 1918.
He was buried with military honors where he fell near
Bouillonville. He had been with us but a few days,
but such was his personality and charm that he had
become as closely identified with the Brigade as the
oldest member of the staff. His death was a personal
loss to every one of us.</p>

<p>Brigade Headquarters was established at St. Mihiel,
Meuse, October 19th, 1918, and the entries in the official
War Diary begin. I have the diary before me as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
I write, and I feel that I cannot do better than take the
information therein practically word for word as it
was recorded each day from October 19th to November
11th.</p>

<p>The famous salient of St. Mihiel had been wiped
out a month before. Having held it successfully for
four long years, the Germans considered their lines
there impenetrable; but it took the Yankees just two
short days, September 12th and 13th to reduce that
four years’ work to nothing, and on our side of the
balance sheet now stood several thousand prisoners
and a few hundred guns. It had happened a month
before, but the battle fields were still fresh with Hun
relics and ruins, and one had but to see to know that
Heine and Fritz had lost no time in their departure.
Everywhere ammunition dumps and other stores were
left untouched by the fleeing foe.</p>

<p>October 19th the 151st Field Artillery Brigade, less
one regiment (the 301st) was attached to the 2nd
Colonial Corps (French) of the Second Army,
A. E. F., as corps artillery, with its rail head at Sorcy
and its Refilling Point at Woinville. The zones and
mission of the Brigade were assigned. In a general
way our sector extended from Bonzee to Vigneulles.
The line in this sector ran roughly northwest to southeast,
the Germans holding the villages of Ville en
Woevre, Pintheville, Riaville, Marcheville, St. Hilaire,
Doncourt and Woel.</p>

<p>October 21st was devoted to reconnaissance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
commanding officer, Colonel Conklin of the 303rd
F. A. and staff arrived. An air raid by the enemy
occurred at 7.00 p. m. They are all alike. This is
what happens. Delicate instruments more sensitive
than the human ear detect the sound of the aeroplane’s
engines at a great distance. These instruments are
placed at intervals along the lines at what are known
as listening posts or stations. Directly an enemy plane
is detected, its whereabouts and direction are telephoned
to the areas behind. There, the fact is announced
by a bugle call, followed by rattles, sirens
and every other variety of music. This is the first
you know of the “ships that pass in the night.” There
is a scramble for the nearest abri, otherwise known
as bomb-proof or dug-out. You stumble and fall down
a flight of steps and find yourself from twenty to forty
feet below ground. It is dark, and the air is damp and
smells vilely. There are from fifty to a hundred other
humans in this subterranean tomb, some lie down,
prepared to spend the night, others, half-clad, shiver
and wait. Then out of the distance you hear a faint
humming as of insects in summer. It grows louder.
It is the engines of the enemy’s planes. Suddenly Hell
is torn loose. The anti-aircraft guns or Archies, as
the British call them, have opened fire from the
ground. The planes return the compliment with bombs
and machine guns. A boiler factory in your head
would not be nearly so bad for your ears as the cracking
and shrieking that takes place. As suddenly as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
started it ceases. All is quiet. We go about our duties
or sleep, as the case may be, until the next raid occurs.
If it is a clear night and the planes are likely to return,
there are many who prefer to stay in the dug-out and
make a night of it there rather than spend the time
until morning running back and forth.</p>

<p>October 22nd the work of reconnaissance for battery
positions and P. C.s<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> continued. More enemy
planes were seen over St. Mihiel. But this time it was
broad daylight; they reconnoitered and took photographs,
but there was no battle royal to disturb the
peace. Suddenly little balls of cotton appeared about
the plane. They were the bursts of some distant anti-aircraft
battery trying to annoy the aviator.</p>

<p>October 23rd the commanding officer (Colonel
Platt) of the 302nd F. A. and staff arrived. In the
afternoon enemy airplanes made a reconnaissance.
The regimental advanced parties arrived.</p>

<p>Reconnaissance was the chief work of the next few
days. Lieutenant Colonel McCabe of the 302nd taking
the area to the north of Bonzee. The Germans
must have had the same idea, for enemy aircraft continued
to pass over Headquarters.</p>

<p>On October 28th the 33rd Division relieved the 79th
Division in this sector, the 55th Field Artillery Brigade
remaining in place, with its Headquarters at
Troyon (P. C. Kilbreith).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Brigadier-General Daniel F. Craig</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>By November 1st all the battery positions and P.
C.s were located and billets were obtained for the
regiments. Colonel Platt of the 302nd F. A. chose
some old German shelters near the one-time village of
St. Remy for his P. C. His batteries were to be
scattered through the Bois des Eparges, mostly to the
north. The 3rd Battalion was to be behind the hills
to the eastward. The country looked like pictures of
the moon sometimes reproduced in scientific magazines
because of interest but never on account of beauty.
Once there had been woods; now there was hardly a
tree standing. All vegetation had been killed by gas
and shell,—crater after crater gave mother earth a
very diseased appearance. Here we spent our days
and nights while the war lasted. Colonel Platt chose
Rupt for his billets.</p>

<p>Colonel Conklin in selecting his P. C. showed better
taste. He found an old German Headquarters, built
like a Swiss chalet in the heart of the woods and far
away from harm. Here he settled comfortably, two
kilometres to the northeast of Deuxnouds and just
South of the Grande Tranchee de Calonne. He had
but two battalions. The first he placed to the east
of his P. C., the second about four kilometres to the
north.</p>

<p>This same day liaison was established with S. R. S.
No. 3 American, and on November 2nd with S. R.
O. T. Nos. 58 and 67.</p>

<p>November 3rd the Brigade Headquarters detachment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
arrived and was billeted in St. Mihiel, and information
was received that the 302nd F. A. had detrained
at Dugny and was moving into Rupt en
Woevre.</p>

<p>November 4th information was received that the
303rd F. A. had detrained at Dugny and was moving
into Creue. The 3rd Battalion of the 303rd was assigned
to the Fourth Army Corps.</p>

<p>November 5th the Second Battalion of the 302nd
reported its guns in position and ready to open fire.
Hardly was this accomplished when the Huns began
to give them a taste of gas, over 3,000 rounds being
reported. One gun of Battery B, 303 F. A. was reported
to be in position. The Brigade was detached
from the 2nd C. A. C. (French), and was put under
the command of the 17th C. A. (French).</p>

<p>November 6th one gun of the 303rd F. A. was ready
to fire at midnight and the other guns were being
moved up as fast as the positions were constructed.</p>

<p>From 10.00 p. m. November 6th to 2.00 p. m. November
7th, about 3,000 gas shells, mostly mustard,
fell near B and F Batteries of the 302nd F. A., but
though other artillery units nearby had a number of
men gassed, the 302nd F. A. had no casualties, thanks
to strict and effectual gas discipline.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of P. C. Gross, Second Battalion of
the 303d, about two hundred gas and high explosive
shells fell, also without casualties.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Field Order No. 1 was issued directing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the 302nd to deliver harassing fire during the
night on Ville en Woevre and on the roads from that
place to Braquis and Hennemont. The 303rd F. A.
was to fire on Hennemont, Pareid, Maizeray and Moulotte.
At 6.10 the orders were changed by telephone
on account of later information, with the result that
the 302nd F. A. took under fire two additional targets,
which were identified only by their coordinates. The
303rd fired at Pareid and Moulotte and on a battery
in the Bois de Harville.</p>

<p>On the night of November 6th and 7th, in a two
company infantry raid with artillery support against
the Chateau d’Ardnois, one German officer and twenty-two
men were captured and from ten to fourteen
killed. Our own casualties were slight. There was
very little enemy artillery fire during the day. At
9.15 however, on the night of November 7th, the
operations officer of the 55th Field Artillery Brigade
at P. C. Kilbreith reported heavy shelling by the
enemy of Fresnes en Woevre. This village was now
strongly held by our troops, and it was thought that
the German fire was in retaliation for the raid. Our
Sound Ranging Section S. R. S. No. 3 had located
the enemy batteries that were executing the fire and
we were asked for neutralization at the earliest possible
moment. This order was sent to the 303rd F. A.
by courier and telephone. At 11.00 a. m. the enemy
having ceased his fire, the 303rd F. A. was ordered
to discontinue firing. Field Order No. 2 was then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
issued authorizing the 303rd F. A. to fire at once for
neutralization upon any enemy battery reported in
action beyond Maizeray. In the meantime Major
Hadley’s Battalion of the 302nd F. A. was fired upon
by the enemy with gas shells. Captain Lefferts was
the only casualty.</p>

<p>On November 8th two strong patrols of our infantry,
sent early in the morning to the Bois de Harville
and St. Hilaire, brought back three prisoners. The
33rd Division reported considerable harassing fire
about Les Eparges and Saulx en Woevre, with some
interdiction fire on the villages at the base of the hills.
The total was about 3,000 rounds. This was the first
day that the air was clear enough for the G. P. F.s
to register, and Colonel Conklin registered on Joinville.
Shortly after 4.00 o’clock, Balloon No. 22 reported
two batteries firing. They were given to the
303rd F. A. for immediate neutralization. In the
meantime, orders had been sent out for the night’s
firing, the targets assigned to the 303rd F. A. being
two batteries of 105 howitzers in the Bois de Harville
and the towns Maizeray and Butgneville. The 302nd
F. A. was given the Pintheville-Maizeray road, the
Pintheville-Pareid road, Maizeray, Butgneville and
St. Hilaire, the latter being the most important. The
fire was to stop at 3.00 a. m. to permit an infantry
raid to go into St. Hilaire and the vicinity. These
orders, sent by telephone and courier, were in response
to a request for help from the Divisional Artillery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
They were followed by a Memorandum to the regiments
designating the zones in which, after the start
of the infantry raid on November 9th, it would not
be safe for them to fire without express authority.</p>

<p>On November 9th a change of organization occurred
as a result of the removal of a large part of the French
Artillery from the sector. The two batteries which
were left,—one of 120 long and one of 155 long,—were
taken over by General Davis and assigned to
the command of Colonel Platt of the 302nd F. A. in
what then became known as the Groupment Platt.
General Davis thus became Commander of the Corps
Artillery of the sector.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of this same day, a request
was received from the infantry through the Operations
Officer of the 55th Field Artillery Brigade for help
in a raid. It appeared that lack of ammunition for
the Divisional artillery threatened to deprive the infantry
of much needed artillery assistance. Orders
were issued for concentration fire between 2.00 and
5.00 a. m. on Maizeray, Butgneville and St. Hilaire
and between 5.00 and 6.45 a. m. on Maizeray and
Butgneville. With the approval of Corps Artillery
Headquarters the regiments were permitted to use
ammunition beyond that authorized for daily expenditure.</p>

<p>The strong reconnoitering patrols sent out by the
33rd Division executed the raid on Marcheville. It
was completely successful and resulted in the capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of eighty prisoners including three officers. Patrols
near Pintheville and Riaville met strong resistance.
At 3.50 p. m. an enemy barrage of about 4,000 shells
was laid down between Fresnes and Wadonville, probably
in retaliation for the raid of the previous night.
Orders were issued that the regiments should fire at
once on any batteries reported in action by the Sound
Ranging Section (S. R. S. No. 3) and that every clear
day should be utilized for registration. During the
afternoon the 303rd F. A. was directed to fire on two
batteries of 210 howitzers,—one near Labouville and
the others northeast of Joinville,—and on a battery
of medium calibre, just south of Moulotte.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we were informed that an
infantry raid would take place at H hour next morning
on our front. The Groupment Platt were ordered
to fire on Maizeray and on the road between
Pintheville and Maizeray. The 303rd was to fire on
Maizeray, Harville and the same stretch of road and
on batteries reported firing from points back of Maizeray.
The fire of both groups was to last for 105
minutes after H hour and at 2.20 in the morning,
notification was sent by courier to the commanding
officers of the two regiments that H hour would be
5.45 a. m.</p>

<p>At 8.30 in the evening the General ordered a concentration
by the 302nd F. A. on Riaville, Pintheville
and the road connecting them, to be fired between midnight
and 3 a. m. At 8.45, the 303rd F. A. was given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
counter-battery work in answer to a call from the
Divisional Artillery Headquarters.</p>

<p>Upon the change in organization mentioned above,
the advanced location for our Brigade P. C. was fixed
at Creue. The regiments were ordered to reconnoitre
to find locations for at least some of their guns out
on the Plain of Woevre where they would be able to
reach some of the German long range artillery which
had been bothering us, and also follow up the advance
of our infantry for a long distance without changing
position for a second time.</p>

<p>On November 10th a general advance was ordered
to begin at 7.00 a. m. but the order did not reach our
Brigade. However, this information was obtained incidentally
by the Brigade Commander, and at 10.40
a. m. orders were issued for the regiments to provide
advance telephone lines, with a view to establishing
forward P. C.s. At the same time the Brigade P. C.
was opened at Creue. A series of orders were issued
over the telephone with reference to a change of positions
by the 302nd F. A. and the 303rd F. A. and at
11.48 we received orders from the corps that the 4.7
regiment must advance as soon as possible. Orders
were sent to them to complete all reconnaissance and
prepare to move immediately. At 1.25 orders were
received from the corps to move two batteries of the
303rd F. A. with 400 rounds of ammunition at the tail
of the main body of the 33rd Division in advance. It
was thought that this was based on the supposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that the enemy was going to retire, which he had no
intention of doing, as later developments showed.</p>

<p>At 4.00 o’clock in the afternoon, word having been
received that the country to the north and east of
Bonzee was occupied by the enemy, an officer was sent
to the 33rd Division occupying our sector and another
to the 81st Division on our left to find out the true
state of affairs. There proved to be no basis whatever
for this report, as the 33rd Division was holding its
forward line in great strength with a view to attacking
on the morning of the 11th, and the 81st Division
was also reinforced for a continuation of their attack,
begun on the 10th.</p>

<p>General Bailey, commanding the 81st Division and
Colonel Roberts, Chief of Staff, urgently requested
artillery help in their attack on Ville en Woevre, Hennemont
and other points. The Brigade supported these
attacks between 5.00 and 7.00.</p>

<p>The commanding General of the 33rd Division, having
received orders to advance, called for support from
the Corps Artillery on Pintheville, Harville, Moulotte,
Maizeray, Pareid and batteries in the Bois de Harville
and elsewhere. This support was given between
9.25 p. m. November 10th and 5.00 a. m. November
11th.</p>

<p>At 7.30 p. m. the 302nd F. A. was ordered to move
one battalion into the advanced positions in the Plain
of the Woevre and to have another battalion in motion
so as to reach its advanced position on the 11th while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the guns held in reserve were to continue the firing.
One battalion, in accordance with these instructions,
took position on the Plain of the Woevre near Tresauvaux,
well in advance of the main body of the infantry
and of the resistance line. It remained there overnight
and until ordered to withdraw on the morning
of the 11th, when news was received that the armistice
had been signed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, three guns of the 303rd F. A.
were successfully moved into similar forward positions
from which, if fighting had continued, they might
have done highly effective work against some of the
distance long range German guns, especially those that
had been bothering St. Maurice, Thillot and other
towns along the base of the hills. The Brigade fired
736 rounds in the course of the day, against a number
of different targets assigned from time to time by
Brigade Headquarters, or reported direct to the regiments
by the S. R. S.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock on the night of the 10th the
French corps commander under whom we were serving,
said he expected important news from the Eiffel
Tower wireless station before morning. He asked
Brigade Headquarters to notify him should our wireless
pick up anything of interest. Taking the daily
communiques from the Eiffel Tower had been part of
our routine work, so the operators knew her<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
intimately. Accordingly they were not unduly surprised
when she started her familiar squeak early on
that historic morning. Received at 5.45 a. m. November
11th, the message that the armistice had been
signed and that hostilities were to cease at 11.00 a. m.
was reported at the Brigade P. C., Creue, by telephone
from the St. Mihiel Headquarters. To the credit of
the Brigade let it be known that it was from our station
that the news was given to the entire sector.</p>

<p>The 33rd Division attacked at 5.00 a. m. Strong
patrols sent out along the front captured three officers
and eighty-three men. Infantry lines were established
at the close of hostilities as follows: Chateau d’Aulnois,
Riaville, Marcheville, St. Hilaire, south of Butgneville,
Bois de Harville thence southward to Ferma
d’Hautes Journeux. These towns were taken on the
morning of the 11th. It was a glorious piece of work
but hardly worth the price in American life it involved.
The Germans, pushed to the limit, made a last stubborn
resistance and from behind their fortifications
and barbed wire delivered a murderous fire on our
troops with rear guard machine gun action from hidden
nests. The battlefield as I saw it that afternoon,
I shall not soon forget. There lay an American sergeant,
where he had fallen, and behind him lay his
men, not twenty yards from the German machine gun
they were attacking. My thoughts were first of sorrow
that these men should have made the supreme
sacrifice in those last minutes of the great war. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
those fine young faces still shone the joy of life, theirs
but yesterday, when they had thought of home and all
it held in store. But I read another story, that of
peace, such as is only experienced after a hard struggle
won and as I looked at the scene I felt a thrill of pride.
What a sacrifice! but God, how gloriously made!</p>

<p>The plans for the early morning attack contemplated
prearranged firing by the Corps Artillery until 7.00
a. m. Information that the Armistice had been signed
having arrived at 5.45 a. m., the Heavy Artillery Commander
at that hour ordered no more firing, unless
urgently called for by some infantry unit which was
in need of help or was being effectively shelled. The
advance Brigade P. C. at Creue was closed at 11.00
a. m. Ammunition had been brought up during the
night and the corps artillery stood ready with some of
its guns advanced beyond the main line of resistance,
to support fully a further general infantry attack.</p>

<p>At 10.55 on the morning of the Armistice, the 303rd
Band at Creue played taps, then the Marseillaise, then
the Star Spangled Banner and then Reveille. All that
morning the artillery thundered and was still thundering
when the music started. When it stopped, all was
still.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of November 12th I walked along
our front between the lines. The stillness of peace
was upon the earth where but yesterday the din of
bloody battle reigned. Our lines were held by a series
of sentries walking their posts as if on parade. Over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
yonder the Germans were doing likewise. The sun
shone in gladness upon the scene. The air was crisp
and the reliefs were gathering wood for their fires.
As the shadows grew longer and the sun set in a blaze
of glory, the figures of the sentries grew dim, but their
positions became identified by the bonfires they had
kindled which now alone marked the lines. As I
turned to go, rockets once used to call for a barrage
or as a warning of gas lit the sky. Thus ended the war.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUMMARY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A resume</span> of the history of the 151st Field Artillery
Brigade during its short term at the front shows a
great variety of services and connections.</p>

<p>Originally constituting a part of the Artillery of the
Second Army, the Brigade was attached on its arrival
in the zone of advance to the Second Colonial Corps
of the French army in the Troyon sector, where it
served under General Blondlat, Corps commander and
General Jaquet, Chief of Artillery.</p>

<p>The Second Colonial Corps was relieved by the 17th
French Corps, General Hellot commanding, General
Walch, Chief of Artillery. On October 29th, the
Brigade came under their command.</p>

<p>On November 13th the Brigade was assigned to the
Fourth American Corps. When the Fourth Corps
moved forward at 5.00 a. m., November 17th, the
Brigade passed into the Second Army Reserve. When
the regiments first came into the St. Mihiel sector, the
infantry holding it were the 79th Division of the American
Army, General Joseph E. Kuhn commanding;
the 39th French Infantry Division and the 28th French
Regiment of Dismounted Cavalry. On the 28th of
October, however, the 79th was relieved by the 33rd
American Division, General George Bell commanding.</p>

<p>The 39th French Infantry Division and the 28th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
regiment of Dismounted Cavalry were withdrawn and
the sector of the 17th Corps was from Vigneulles to
Bonzee.</p>

<p>The Corps Artillery, 151st Brigade and two batteries
of French Artillery à Pied, covered the entire front
of fifteen kilometres.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is the story of our few days at the front before
the Armistice, and this is what we did in the actual
fighting.</p>

<p>I have been obliged for lack of space and knowledge
to omit those things most interesting to the individual—little
incidentals, perhaps from the point of view of
the rest of us, but to him they constituted the war,
and always will. For this reason they will remain
forever vivid pictures in his memory and are therefore
not necessary to chronicle. At the same time it will
do no harm to recall a few more facts and feelings that
all in one way or another experienced during that
momentous although brief period of our lives. Mud is
perhaps the foremost to the author. But there were
others. At night there was not a light as we stumbled
and cursed, feeling our way in those ruined villages;
automobiles and trucks travelled similarly without
lights in the jet blackness, sometimes on the road but
more often off it. And the drivers, let us not forget
them and their troubles: the sinking feeling in the
region of the stomach as the truck, laden to its limit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
with ammunition, would itself first sink and then stick
in that sea of mud. Tired to the point of exhaustion,
they would dig for hours and get out only to be in
again a hundred yards down the road. Or perhaps
Buddy, with his truck, would try to pull us out with
the result that he too got stuck. Then there were the
nights spent going into position where the impossible
was often accomplished,—that was work such as few
outside of the army will experience,—but it was exciting
and it was necessary, and that explains how it
was done. Following this were the nights spent in
serving the guns,—sleepless nights,—but it was fun,
and the excitement made it interesting. Last but not
least, let us recall for a second, if we can, how it felt
to be under fire,—but most of us were too busy and
tired to have any feelings. Such as they were they
were hardly pleasant.</p>

<p>While most of the Brigade was thus solving its
troubles, the 3rd Battalion of the 303rd was having
troubles of its own. Detached from the Brigade and
assigned to the Fourth Corps on November 4th, they
were ordered to take a position a thousand metres in
front of the Seventy-fives and about the same distance
behind our own front line. The terrain assigned them
for their guns was a wooded swamp, perhaps a thousand
metres from the road. It was down this road
that they brought their guns under practically continuous
enemy fire. Nor did the fire stop when they
reached their positions. Just as regularly as the half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
hours came around on the clock so did the Germans go
the rounds of these two batteries and Battalion Headquarters
with high explosive and gas. There were
many narrow escapes but no serious casualties. The
dispersion of the German guns and the regularity with
which they fired were alone responsible, so say the
Third Battalion. But I am inclined to think, in spite
of German declarations of “Gott mit Uns”, that the
Bon Dieu was on our side; for besides the elements
above mentioned, practically every direct hit or what
was so close as to amount to a direct hit, proved to
be a dud. Of the labors involved in taking this position
and the will that delivered the goods we cannot
say enough. The job was done and done gloriously.</p>

<p>While the Brigade, minus one regiment, was disporting
itself in and about St. Mihiel, that regiment,
the 301st F. A. was ordered to another part of the
front, November 2nd. Accordingly they went to Neufchateau
near Chaumont, where they were to become a
part of the Army Artillery for the 1st army. There
they were held in reserve and obliged to wait for further
orders, which did not come. Finally it was learnt
that they were to move forward and take up positions
about November 12th, but the Germans also hearing
of this, signed the Armistice on the 11th. So it was
that our lost regiment did not get into action. We
sympathize with them, but we do not feel as they do,
for we know the goods were there and given the opportunity,
would have been delivered. On November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
29th they were ordered to prepare for return to the
United States. Many miserable weeks followed at
Brest, but finally, one glorious day, the Statue of
Liberty appeared before them and January 6th, 1919,
they landed in New York from the good ship “Nieuw
Amsterdam”. In this the rest of the Brigade fared
not so well.</p>

<p>After the Armistice was signed, the regiments were
withdrawn to billets and the materiel was parked. The
302nd returned to Rupt en Woevre, where they got
busy on the famous show they produced a few weeks
later. The 303rd were not as easily satisfied. They
had some troops still in and about the positions,—some
more at Creue, a lot more at Savannieres, and
the 3rd Battalion which had rejoined the regiment
was now at St. Christophe Ferme. Later, the First
and Second Battalions moved to Troyon and the Third
Battalion to Ambly, while regimental Headquarters
was established at St. Mihiel.</p>

<p>While thus in billets there were many rumors, but
they were mostly of “occupation” with the Third
Army. The fact was, we were kept busy policing the
villages and a good part of France. The part we got
was not in the very best of order, so we had our hands
full. At the same time it was not all work; the 302nd
show took us out of the mud and gunk of the busted
villages of France and dropped us temporarily in front
of the foot-lights of Broadway. There were other
bright spots but they were not the weather. Meantime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
we waited for we knew not what. We got to know
our French brothers in arms, and we sympathized with
them for all they had lost. But they demanded our
admiration even more than our sympathy. In the
face of ruined homes and brothers lost, they could
say: “C’est la guerre” and could sing with us the Marseillaise
and Madelon:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV. HOME</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> December 20th the order to prepare arrived.
Prepare for what? The United States of America.
My God was it possible? Where were they? But it
was so, and a better Christmas present would have
been hard to find. This was our second Christmas in
the army, and apparently it was to be our last. Cheers!
The occasion however recalled a remark attributed to
General Pershing in August as follows: “Hell, Heaven
or Hoboken by Christmas.” He was right, and we got
seats at the first show on his list.</p>

<p>On January 3rd 1919, the Brigade was ordered to
Bordeaux for transportation to the United States, and
on January 8th it entrained at Bannoncourt. It was
hoped by all that we would return to our old billets,—but
no, they took us back to that Godforsaken Camp
de Souge. We arrived January 11th. However it
would not be for long and we were on our way home.
All were cheerful,—some artificially so. Little did
we realize that it was to be a stay of three long months
and that we would be allowed to amuse ourselves with
skinning mules and guard duty. Looking backwards
we can laugh, but I doubt if we could have done so
at the time had we known how long it was to be. On
February 4th the General and some of his staff sailed
from Genecart on the “Matsonia”. This was encouraging;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
we would follow soon, but we did not.
However on March 18th we moved to Pauillac, about
twenty-five miles down the river from Bordeaux,
where there are docks and delousing plants.</p>

<p>And on April 13th we sailed for Boston on the
“Santa Rosa”. And here I must leave, for it is the
author’s desire that this little sketch be ready when
the brigade lands.</p>

<p>And what has it all amounted to? To many at first
thought it has been but a year and a half taken out of
their lives. But let us consider for a second. Here
was every American energy bent for the first time to
the accomplishment of a single purpose. The individual
and his every interest was sacrificed for a great
cause. We learned that there was something bigger
than self and more worth while. We learned to appreciate
our vast country as we should have been able
to do in no other way.</p>


<p class="center">“NOT WHAT WE DID,<br />
BUT WHAT WE WERE WILLING TO DO.”</p>
